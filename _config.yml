user_description: BlissForge is a home-based indie game studio focused on the arcade genre. Founded in 2012 by the sole proprietor Lorenzo Pappalettera, a high school graduate game-developer who specializes in AI development and has lots of expertise in code architecture. We use well-known building blocks as well as our own. Most things we make in-house from scratch. We strive to create games with the same level of quality as AAA games. If you can dream it, we can make it! We are always on the search for something profound.
